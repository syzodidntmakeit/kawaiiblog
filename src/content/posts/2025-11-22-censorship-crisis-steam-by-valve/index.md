## Governments, Credit Cards and Women Activists

I need you to understand something right now. The internet doesn't exist. It's all smokes and fucking mirrors. No the mirrors aren't fucking… I think.

Steam. You know the place you go to to see if Dark Soul 3 is finally on sale? That one. A platform to buy games, and game cosmetics. The platform where you have over 100 games and only ever play the 3. It kinda has become ground zero for the most comprehensive digital censorship campaign in gaming history. Are any form of medium. Yes, this is the apparent convergence of state-sanctioned blockades, corporate financial chokepoints, and bitch ass activists pressure campaigns that, in the span of about a year and a half, absolutely shattered the illusion that digital content flows freely across waters.

This has to be that sad shit this week to ruin your weekend. Let's start with nobody's favourite:

## Vietnam; Protection is the new Sovereignty

Unlike Singapore, Vietnam has completely and utterly, blocked Steam. No vietnamese blood shall be tainted by the toxic of Valve's quality video game marketplace!

This rust wasn't some gradual erosion. May of 2024, Vietnam gamers woke up (reluctantly) finding themselves unable to access the Steam storefont. Literally every fucking Internet Service Provider in Vietnam had all collectively revoked access to any of Steam's web address; From major/state-owned giants like Viettel and VNPT to private companies like FPT Telecom. (No! Not FPtelecom! RIP the 3 people that still use it...) Here's how they kinda did it.

Domain Name System poisoning. Whenever you search for google.com, your ISP calls from a DNS server for that IP address that google.com is connected to. If there isn't an IP address to it, your ISP would give a 404 error. DNS poisoning basically means giving the wrong IP address or outright removing it. Thus, https://store.steampowered.com/ gave the vietnamese people an error. But a way to avoid this is using another DNS instead, since Vietnam only has access to its local DNS servers. Meaning connecting your internet connection to a Google or Cloudflare DNS could bypass this toxicity. Did this work? Yes. Until...

Mid-2024, direct IP blocking and Server Name Indication filtering. This meant that ANYTHING that Steam uses for it's IP addresses is blocked; the store, the community, your friends list were all gone. But you still had your own local library, cuz it only block requesting, it can't stop you from playing games you already have installed. Ok well... Block it in Vietnam, I'll just use a Virtual Private Network that connects me to a server in another country bypassing the IP blocking. And it worked. Until... (Yes, again)

They went nuclear. Payment gateways blocked at the banking level. Vietnamese credit cards and local payment wallets like MoMo and ZaloPay actively reject transactions to Valve. Like an ex they still hasn't moved on, making sure Steam had no business in the well well country of Vietnam. (Honestly, God bless. I fucking hate it when I get 4 fucking teammates who couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat. The ONLY way to buy a game in Vietnam is to have a foreign bank account, at which point... Just move, bro. Just maybe not to here. We do not need more of you.

What's crazy is that this is, quite literally, by LAW! The framework that enabled this gas chamber was named Decree 147/2024/ND-CP (how creative), replacing the older, more ambiguous Decree 72. And this pass is a fucking masterclass in authoritian overreach wearing a coat as a "consumer protection" identity. Check this out.

This law mandates that any and all offshore video game providers must establish a local enterprise in Vietnam to operate. Sounds good, right? Yeah. Just spend years developing a Valve headquaters (an Amercian company) in the other side of the fucking world. And it HAS to be enterprise, not just a representative office where you could operate for researching in foreign marketplace. Which means it would be subject to higher Vietnamese tax laws, Vietnamese data localization requirements, Vietnamese content censorship and Vietnamese hire. By the way, Steam, and I mean Steam not Valve, only has 79 employees. This decree demands for user data to be stored inside physical Vietnam servers, shit like full names, dates of birth, phone numbers, fully accessible by the Ministry of Public Security whenever the fuck they wanted. You might think, "That's hella intrusive", and then you realize it is indeed a communist country. So what in the Patrick Starfish fuck did you expect, dumbass? And God forbid Steam had any content on their local servers that deemed "illegal" or "culturally inappropriate" (whatever the fuck that means), cuz that would stipple them to a LOT of fines, or worse, outright sue'd by the MoPS.

If this was any other company, they would immediatly teamed up with a local business in order to maintain their structure in the Vietnam market. But the Gigachad that is Steam said, "Fuck that. Our shit is direct to consumer. If they wanna jerk off to furry porn, they can. As long as I get a cut, ofc".

But here's what's REALLY fucked up (if it wasn't already), this obviously isn't about "national security" or "proteting the children" _cough_ Child Safety Act _cough_, this is purely about their ego and power tripping. And money of course. Cuz if you had a local business, I can tax you to the moon and back. But if you operate over digital means, something I can't control, I can't make money from it. So Imma just ban it. Cuz I am a bitch ass pussy. Speaking of pussies...

Vietnam Multimedia Corporation, which is state-owned (totally not corrupt, trust), spent years, maybe a decade, lobbying for this ban. Why? Isn't it obviously? Uh... Unfair competition and uh... not paying taxes... not submitting games for content approval? Taxes is fair point, anything else is stroking off the Viet govt at this point. But the funnny thing, totally unreleated of course, VNG Corp and VTC's entire business model is licensing foreign games (mostly from China cuz they also censor shit so fucking much) and sell them locally, they don't even make their own fucking shit. So when Vietnamese gamers were buying games from Steam, VNG, or is it PNG? Who gives a shit, they're all the same rent-seeking assholes, and VTC weren't getting a cut. But it's absolutely totally really not related to why they would wanna ban Steam from operating in Vietnam...

Literally killed competition by crying to big daddy, those scruwny scoundrels. They lobbied for Decree 147 that got passed now they out here being gatekeepers. Vietnamese indie developers that used Steam for community outreach? Fucked. Vietnamese gamers who had a huge library from Steam, especially for in-game cosmetics? Had to use a VPN or Fucked. And they refuse to pirate, even when having no other options. Which, I mean I love pirating content, but that's hella dope for them to still wanna pay for it ong. The "high-tech dream" of Vietnam becoming a software development hub? Forget it. Fucking hypocrits.

Driven entirely by consolidation of power under figures like To Lam, who went from Minister of Public Security to President/General Secretary. He pioneered the anti-corruption campaign which is of good notability. He just didn't tell anyone that it would also mean having complete control over information flow. Steam, with its anonymous accounts and encrypted chat, was a major red flags for "totally secure" Vietnam.

## Indonesia: Probationary Models are sick

Indonesia. Beautiful country. Had an ex girlfriend from there, but we never lasted more than a month. Also never been cuz I refuse to get off my fat fucking ass to travel. Me like home, sir! And what they did, was far more insidious in my unprofessional opinion.

August of 2022, on a random Tuesday, Ministry of Communication and Information Technology of Indonesia or Kominfo, had blocked Steam, Epic Games and PayPal for failing to register as a Private Electronic System Provider. And there already is a lot of questions. What is the PSE? Why did they fail to comply? What does that mean for the industry, seeming as Indonesia is the 4th biggest country in the world (holy shit you guys love sex don't you)? Well how about you shut the fuck up for a second. I'm finna explain, man. Damn. Valve capitulated and completed the PSE registration. Great. Right?

No. Why would it? PSE basically means: Valve agrees to comply with government takedown requests within 24 hours for any media that deems urgent under the Indonesian government, to provide authorities with access to user data for law enforcement purposes, and to operate under the constant threat of having the PSE registration revoked at any fucking moment. And no, Valve would never had agreed to these terms. But what had happened was what seemed to be out of the blue, and as Indonesia is literally Steam's 3rd biggest market with a total users of 112M (not active, but the potential is fucking massive), right behind India with their 854M and Brazil's 148M users, Valve had to rush to apply for the PSE, not fully understanding what they agreed to. If Valve had even 24 hours to read the Terms, they would have requested for a meeting with Kominfo for a special agreement (which they may or may not agree to). Unlike Vietnam, Indonesia DOES get a cut of every purchase from within Indonesia's Steam market, so this is more of a symbiotic relationship between Valve's Steam and Indonesia's huge playerbase.

So. Steam is still accessible in Indonesia, but it's operating on probation. The government has the legal right to revoke Valve's PSE certifications and reimpose the ban instantly, for if Valve fails to comply with their censorship featuring LGBTQ+ or politcal dissent. For a country with a population of hot twinks and furries, they sure hate gay people. I _am_ a Christian, but holy shit does this piss me the fuck off.

And this gets to something important about modern censorship. Blocking something is for pussies and you get a ton of public backlash, especially from locals. Forcing censorship through compliance is much more efficient as it still insinuates business just with heavy restrictions, and you get significantly less hate from the people. WHich ultimately is more important than anything. Minister Budi Arie Setiadi, appointed in 2023, has been pushing hard for data localization by forcing companies like Google to build physical data centers in Indonesia. The message is clear: you want access to our market? You play by our rules. And in the special case of Indonesia, purely based on the sheer population, is a market worth tapping into.

## Russia and China: The Blueprint for Compliance

Want to see the future? Look east.

Russia hasn't banned Steam. They don't need to. By late 2025, Valve had removed or geo-blocked over 260 items at the request of Roskomnadzor—community pages, guides, games that violated Russian laws (probably anything with "LGBT propaganda" or narratives about the Ukraine war). The store is accessible, but it's a hollowed-out version. Community pages are frequently inaccessible, and direct payments are impossible due to sanctions, forcing users to buy keys from third-party resellers. The "no ban" status is a strategic choice by Russia to avoid the social unrest of banning Counter-Strike while effectively neutering the platform's social and political potential.

China? Even more dystopian. The "Steam China" client (officially sanctioned) exists alongside "Steam Global" (technically blocked but accessible through "accelerators"—quasi-VPNs that are legal and widely tolerated). The government lets enthusiasts access the global market through this grey channel to keep them pacified, while strictly policing the official Steam China Showcase, which features only sanitized, approved titles. It's a bifurcated reality: a clean, official store for the masses, and a difficult, monitored backdoor for the diehards.

This is the endgame for Vietnam and Indonesia. Not bans. Compliance. A neutered, censored version of Steam that looks like the real thing but has had its teeth pulled.

Ok so Asia sucks fucking balls. Indonesia domesticated Steam, while Vietnam killed it. So Vietnam is that Mistress you visit on the weekends and Indonesia is an insecure girlfriend. But I can't be worse back in America, right?

## The West: When Karens Weaponize Your Credit Card

Yes it can. You know what's more frightening than foreign government? Private local companies. It's sad we live in such a world. And in this case, it's Visa and Masturbate... I mean Mastercard. The ultimate arbiters of what content you're allowed to access. But how does a card company controll what I see? Well... it kinda doesn't, but it holds power to. Let me explain.

Enter the Sin against God; Collective Shout, an Austrailian advocacy group that had previously went after Rockstar's Number 1 title and highest grossing content ever made, Grand Theft Auto V, pulling out of Australian retail shelves. Some say it might be possible that GTA V wouldv'e made 200 million sold instead of the approximately 168 million it currently has. God bless Australia. Well, in mid-2025, these fucks launched a targetted campaign alleging that Steam and Itch.io were hosting games featuring "rape, incest, and sexual violence". Which is 100% the case. Sex in video games had always been an issue, a very good example is GTA V itself. Some games feature content involving rape or being abused as a medium to get a point across, displaying struggles that some people may go through, in the form of an interactive media. And yes, some games are made entirely for satisfaction, games that revolve around pornography or pornographic imagery. And as much as they are explicit, it doesn't break laws or rules. Steam states if a game shows exlpicit content, there must be an option to turn it off, or be rated for a more mature audience. GTA V was given a rating of M for mature audience under the ESRB, meant for audience above 17+. But let's be honest, I remember playing it on my cousin's PS3 at 9 years. But that's not what's wrong here.

Collective Shout could have gone to Valve directly with their concerns, they could have contacted regulators and requested a more strict compliance on "rape, incest and sexual violence" in their content. Which I absolutely belive Valve would bend head over heels for the Australian market. It isn't their biggest market, not even close, and explicit content had always been an issues for the Australian market, so having heavy restrictions on Steam content only for Aussies wouldn't be an impossible ask. But that's not what these bitches did. Because they wanted Valve to be hurt.

Instead, they aimed payment processors. These are companies that regulate the payment processes of digital content. Think music files, tickets, shipping products from China, or in this case, video games. They sent about 3,000 letters to Visa and Mastercard executives with a simple, devasting argument. _By processing payments for Steam, your financial network is profiting from the abuse of women and children._ These executives are 60 year old men who don't understand video games, instead are experts in business. And understanding basic analogy of supporting abuse of women and children was bad for business, were pressure to do something about it. They did not understand how video games work, and Collective Shout knew that, and took advantage of it.These payment processors are terrified of being associated with anything that could trigger a regulatory investigation or PR shitstorm. Mastercard and Visa aren't moral arbiters by choice—they're cowards optimizing for brand safety in a litigious world. Thus, Visa and Mastercard folded like tents made from... (Well, I would say China but I had bought a tent from China and it had suprising quality so...)

Mastercard Rule 5.12.7: ...prohibits any transaction that is illegal, or in the sole disretion of the Corporation, may damage the goodwill of the Corporation. This basically means "I can revoke your ability to transact with our services because me no likey you, bruh. Roses." It doesn't have to be illegal perse, it just has to be something Mastercard thinks that might hurt their brand, which Valve agreed to, thus Valve is unable to find compensation for their lost of a transaction partner. And Visa and Mastercard being literally the 2 biggest companies for digital transaction, Valve fell into a frenzy. There was no alternatives. "Ban me in Vietnam? I'll serve to Singapore" but revoke transactions, means nobody can buy games, which mean Valve won't get a cut on any purchases, and worse, game publishers can't sell their games. In some countries, the only way to buy games were with Steam credits, which cannot be exchanged for real money.

July 2025, Valve updated their Steamworks onboarding policy with what developers call 'Rule 15', which prohibits "content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam's payment processors and related card networks." Valve panicked and tried to defend their exisiting policies of allowing all legal content, but payment processors had denied it, and leaked statements to Kotaku in August of 2025 suggested Valve agreed that "Payment processors rejected this, and specifically cited Mastercard's Rule 5.12.7 and risk to the Mastercard brand." What followed was a warzone...

The purge. Throughout July and August 2025, hundreds of games were delisted from Steam. Visual novels with romantic themes got cut because of their anime aesthtic. Queer games like Robert Yang's work had been swept up in their dragnet on Itch.io and games like Vile:Exhumed, which featured gore and difficult themes, despite not explicitly showing pornographic images, were removed or forced into hiding. Games were being pulled by Steam. This is the first time that this has happened since Steam become for third party software back in late 2005. At this time, the ironclad legends that were Valve, shivered. Fear was instilled for the very first time. And it is a chilling vision writing this.

This was immediate and profound. Developers reported that Valve stopped allowing games with any mature themes to launch in Early Access, killing a critical funding mechanism for narrative-heavy indie titles that rely on episodic development.

There's speculation in development communities that this slug is connected to the broader political climate in the US, speaking of the influence of conservative political initiatives like "Project 2025", or Trump's policy to only recognizing 2 genders. The fear is that the appointment of conservative figures to financial oversight bodies has emboldened payment processors to adopt a more puritancial stance on content. I think this is unlikely however, as there was zero evidence that had linked Trump's governing polices to suggest that it had any effect on Steam's brutal purge. But it could be that Collective Shout had just stolen the spotlight for it, and had it happen quicker instead.

Whatever the case is, the damage is done. The precedent has been set. Valve did it once now, they could do it again. This makes a note in everyone's playbook to be catious when starting business with Valve. Private financial infrastructure can be weaponized to enforce moral codes that have nothing to do with legality.

## The Indie Apocalypse: A Requiem for Small Devs

There's also the deep saturated box that is the indie titles. 40% of games released on Steam had failed to recoup their $100 listing fee. Over 12,700 games were released in a single year. That is 12,700 individuals or studios that had spent either months to years in development and production. Yet still in oversaturation.

Losing access to the Vietnamese and Indonesian markets is a death sentence for indie devs, one that weren't even charged for. Vietnam ranks #1 in mobile games in the global market and has such a massive PC playerbase. For multiplayer indie games, concurrent users are the lifeblood of viral success. Losing millions of Vietnamese players would mean you destroy the network effects that make or break a game.

The Financial censorship crisis has structurally damaged the development process itself. Valve's quiet policy shift in late 2025 to restrict mature themes in Early Access removes the funding capabilites for indie developers. They can no longer release an alpha version of a narrative game to fund the rest of development if it contains controversial themes. Some games tried to pull a 'This is America'—hiding controversial themes behind a friendly facade during Early Access, hoping to implement them in the final release—but no evidence suggests this worked. Or maybe my research is shit.

The ban in Vietnam forces international indie developers back into the arms of intermediaries like VNG and VTC. Since they can't sell directly on Steam, they have to license their games to local publishers to reach the Vietnamese market legally. This transfers value from creators to rent-seeking publishers. The dream of a direct creator-to-consumer economy has been replaced by a neo-feudal system where local monopolies act as toll collectors.

## It's about control

I don't care if you're not Vietnamese or don't play actually explicit games like Hentai Sim. This is about being treated like a child by people who have too much ego, or worse, think what their doing is right.

Every one of these censorship mechanisms—whether it's Vietnam's Decree 147, Indonesia's PSE registration, or Mastercard's Rule 5.12.7—treats you like a child who can't be trusted to make your own decisions. A 30-year-old gamer in Hanoi or New York is prevented from purchasing legal fiction because a regulator or a bank executive deems it "inappropriate."

This is infantilization at scale. And it fosters exactly the kind of resentment and cynicism toward institutions—both state and corporate—that corrodes democratic society.

This severs cultural connections. A Vietnamese gamer can no longer easily participate in the global zeitgeist of a new game release. They're isolated, playing in a "walled garden" of approved content or struggling with VPN lag in a digital ghetto.

And for those who were forced into piracy to access content they already _legally_ purchased, the irony is palpable: governments attempting to secure "data sovereignty" and "tax revenue" have pushed citizens into an unregulated, untaxed, insecure black market.

As we push towards 2026, Steam loses it's identity of being open is practically zero. Not based on Valve's incompetency, far fucking from it actually, by the powers put in place against the David that is Valve and us the consumers are too strong, we have to dance before Goliath. There are ongoing US-Vietnam trade negotiations, though Steam won't be a priority. Vietnam views Decree 147 as a matter of national security, specifically a regime survival via information control. They're not trading their digital sovereignty for tariff reductions on textiles.

There's speculation about Valve creating its own payment processor or adopting cryptocurrency, but the regulatory scrutiny and volatility make that unlikely for a mainstream company. Goddamn crypto bros ruin everything.

And what is most probable is a federated model: Steam West (sanitized, compliant with Visa/Mastercard moral codes), Steam China/Vietnam (ID-locked, censored, operated with local proxies like VNG), and a shrinking grey zone of direct downloads and crypto-payments for content that falls through the cracks.

Piracy is on the rise, and it wasn't even Steam's fault.

I know this is bleak as fuck, high off doomerism. This is a documentation of actual events that happens. Crisis isn't just a fantasy like Iron Man (the first one, the rest are ass). Crisis is here. And it's among us... Don't. Don't do the bit. Shut up.

The openess of the ever-internet was always fragile, held together by corporate restraint, regulatory ambiguity, and the assumption that digital borders were unenforceable, but those assumptions are dead in the water with the fishes full of microplastics. We are currently in the age of the Splinternet, where your geographic location determines what content you see, what games you play, what communities you can join, what bitch you fuck...

## What now, gang?

Nothing. That's the answer. You do nothing because there's nothing to do. The infrastructure of the internet—ISPs, payment processors, regulatory bodies—was never designed to protect your freedom. It was designed to extract value and maintain control. Steam was the aberration, not the norm. The last 20 years were a glitch in the matrix where we thought we lived in a borderless digital commons, but that commons was always built on land owned by landlords.

So you adapt. You VPN. You pirate. You buy keys from grey-market resellers. You build decentralized alternatives that'll get crushed the moment they gain traction. Or you just accept that the garden walls are closing in and the only games you'll play are the ones your government, your bank, and a handful of Australian activists have pre-approved for you.

The splinternet isn't coming. It's here. And it's not going anywhere.
