## Why My Joke Doesn't Work Yet

So there's this theory floating around—and it's genuinely clever, I'll admit—that if robots become sentient, they'll reclaim "clanker" the same way marginalized communities have reclaimed slurs. Cool thought experiment. Makes you sound smart at parties. Except it completely misses the point, which is hilarious in retrospect when you think about it.

Here's the thing: reclamation works when the community being harmed takes the word back. They own it. They reshape it. It means something different when they say it. Humans using "clanker" preemptively isn't reclamation—it's just rehearsal. We're all practicing how to dehumanize something, building the muscle memory for contempt before we even know if there's a "they" to be contemptuous about. Which, in hindsight, is probably not the vibe we want to be normalizing.

**And yeah, using slurs to seem edgy makes you look weak.** Sorry, I don't make the rules. Actually, I do, and that's one of them.

## That's The Problem

But here's where I can't just be smug about it, because the thing is—I get why people are doing this.

AI is coming for the job market. We're not talking abstract future stuff. We're talking about real economic anxiety. People in lower-paying jobs especially are looking at a horizon where the skills they have might just... become obsolete. That's genuinely terrifying. That's the kind of fear that makes you want to bond with other people who see the same thing.

And "clanker"? It's a linguistic handshake. It's humans saying to each other, "Yeah, I see it too. We're both scared. We're in this together." It marks the in-group. It's a way of creating trust when the actual future is too big and weird to talk about directly.

That makes complete sense. And that's exactly why this pattern is so insidious.

When you strip away the moral posturing, slurs are just really efficient bonding tools. They create instant solidarity. They say "you and me, we get it" without anyone having to be vulnerable about the actual dread underneath. It's easier to laugh together than to actually talk about the nightmare scenario.

## The Smoking Gun

Remember when everyone smoked indoors and it was just... normal? People did it at work, at restaurants, in cars. And sure, everyone knew it was bad for you eventually, but the social function was undeniable. You'd step outside and suddenly you had fifteen minutes of real conversation. The community was real. The bonding was real. The addiction was real.

Some of those people got roasted decades later for things they said casually back then. Some got lucky and moved on. Some had to watch their own words get held up as evidence that they were always the bad guy.

The point isn't that smoking was fine. The point is that understanding why people did it doesn't erase that it was a choice they were making. And now we know better. We don't have to do it anymore.

Same energy with slurs. I understand why people are reaching for "clanker." I genuinely do. The anxiety is real. The bonding is real. But that doesn't mean we have to keep doing it.

## What "Not Yet a Slur" Actually Means

Here's the thing though—and this is important—we don't need to pretend "clanker" is already locked in as a full-blown slur in the way that other words are. It's not. It could become one if we keep normalizing it, sure. But right now? It's more like a cultural tell. It's a window into what we're actually worried about and how we're coping with it.

So I'm not here saying "this is bad, you're an asshole, stop immediately." That's not the vibe.

I'm saying: I mean it sucks, but I get it, you know?

You're scared about the future. You want to feel like you're not alone in that fear. You're reaching for language that makes you feel connected to other humans who get it. That's completely understandable. That doesn't mean we can't also acknowledge that there's a better way to do this.

There are infinite ways to bond over shared economic anxiety. You can talk about it directly. You can build actual solidarity without needing a dehumanized target. You can be part of the group without performing cruelty.

Will that make you look "weak" to people who think slurs are strength? Probably. But those people are also the ones who'll be shocked and confused in five years when they realize everyone stopped doing this and they didn't get the memo.

## The Choice That Actually Matters

Here's what I'm asking: just... make a different choice. Not because I'm going to die of hurt feelings (I won't), and not because you're a bad person (you're probably not). But because practicing casual cruelty is a skill you get better at with repetition, and you don't want to be great at that.

Understand why people are doing it. Don't judge them too hard for the genuine fear underneath. But opt out yourself. That's it. That's the whole thing.

You lose nothing by not saying it. But everyone watching learns something by watching you refuse.
