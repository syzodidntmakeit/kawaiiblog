## Welcome to the Future

This is the first post on the newly re-engineered KawaiiBlog. We've moved from a standard setup to a high-performance, lightweight static site generated with **Astro**.

### Why the Change?

I wanted something that loads instantly, even on a potato phone. The web has become too bloated. We're bringing it back to basics, but keeping it stylish.

### The Tech Stack

- **Astro**: For zero-JS by default.
- **Vanilla CSS**: No frameworks, just pure style.
- **Markdown**: For easy writing.

Stay tuned for more deep dives into tech, music, and whatever else crosses my mind.

## What to Expect

1. **Tech Rants**: Linux, privacy, and why software is getting worse.
2. **Music Reviews**: Deep dives into albums that matter.
3. **Commentary**: Thoughts on the state of the internet.

*See you space cowboy...*
