## Grand Theft Auto: 2077

Imagine Grand Theft Auto but in futuristic cyberpunk. Well that’s a complete fucking lie. It is its own world of storytelling, buildings and structure, character, options you can choose and paths to finish the story where it may take 15 hours to complete a single run, but hundreds of hours to get all the endings and explore EVERYTHING this game has to offer. Both story and side content.

Night City is one of the most immersive open worlds I've ever explored. It's the kind of game that keeps you up at 3 AM because "just one more gig" turns into five more hours. Which makes what I’m about to tell you so much more fucking sad.

It got pulled from the PlayStation Store, refunded out of the game dev’s pocket. Lawsuits were filed. Death threats on Twitter (tbf nothing new here). But what the fuck happened?

## Act I: “Check this out!”

This is 2012. Far Cry 3 is released and being called “Skyrim with guns” makes my skin crawl. A Swedish man suffering from depression from a car accident called Cry of Fear (the creator has since been involved in serious controversies) and GTA 5 is anticipated for next year.

But wittle baby boi CD Projekt Red announced _Cyberpunk 2077_ after acquiring the rights to Mike Pondsmith’s Cyberpunk tabletop RPG universe. Weird. But after the teaser trailer gave half the gaming industry a boner (wish i was there), full production didn’t start till 2016. Why? Oh, they only released a little game called the **fucking Witcher 3**. So they didn’t start fully focusing on coding the yellow killing game in 2016. Investors and fans were not too happy. Neither was Twitter but name one time they were lmao. But this raises an issue for them.

### Witcher 3 Problem

Why did releasing a good game bring problems? Same thing with Valve and Rockstar Games. When you show you could pull it off, your next move is to outdo yourself. And only the mentioned along with FROMSOFTWARE have done it thus far.

This also meant that delaying games WERE worth the wait. Which you and I both know already.

> _If you gave shit time to produce, it produces quality_.

Shocker. hmm…

## Act II: “Times ticking, samurai.”

CD Projekt Red makes a massive decision; **reboot development**. From 3rd person to 1st person. Which is big fucking deal because that meant you had to redevelopment certain physics in the game engine, rewrite the story and narrative to fit the different perspective and overall graphics like guns.

### Why tf did they do that?

I can’t tell you exactly _why_ they did but we can come to conclusions based on the finished product, interviews with the developers and my personally opinions. Which if you didn’t like my opinion, I kindly suggest you stop reading and fuck off.

One justification for the switch; immersion. Which I totally agree. I feel like I am V climbing over obstacles and gunning down enemies (sounds corny ik). This also allows for a complex mechanic in the game to be implemented into the game easier; hacks. It IS the future and hacking doors, jamming guns, blowing up tankers and seeing through objects are possible. But with this, you needed a UI (User Interface) to allow the player to interact with this feature. It would be FAR more immersive if it’s happening through the character’s eyes instead of a floating camera behind the character.

One of the developers said that this change allowed them to “immerse the player further in the world and home in on the megacorpo motif”. Which meant actually _feeling_ like you’re living in Night City through V’s cybernatically-enhanced eyes that would provide diegetic UI information, instead of just looking at it from another perspective.

Lead developer Alvin Liu explained another crucial factor: "Since it's first-person, literally you can shoot someone within a second. You pull the gun and you're immediately shooting people. That to us is really important and really immersive because it feels like danger. It was one of the big reasons why we actually switched from third-person.” Which I personally disagree with. Take Grand Theft Auto 5 for example, you had to use a weapons wheel. In 1st person or 3rd, scrolling through your categorical circle to select your weapon, especially during combat does not have a noticeable delay that pulls you out of the immersion of the character.

One thing I did notice is the seamless transitions between exploration, dialogue and combat without jarring camera cuts. It is common in open-world adventure video games for that transition to be stilted either by camera control or characters disappearing behind the camera. So it is rather impress for this game to perform it almost perfectly. Seamless transition in games is nothing new, but still not seen enough. Like the newer God of War games where the major narrative is that the entire game takes place in a single camera take.

> More of that please.

But the biggest factor for this change is this decision came in 2016, years after the initial announcement. A game that has already been built around the 3rd person perspective is now being written in 1st, meant features like flying cars and wall running could not be implemented into the game (at least not well). This made the elaborate character customization system entirely fucking useless. You only ever got to see your character when V looks into the mirror halfway through the story, when you upgrade your cybernatics, change your clothes or look down.

### There is another

There was another game that did this, but had done it so well, you don’t even remember that it happened.

Grand Theft Auto 5 was released in September 2013. An open world game in 3rd person perspective and it’s own story. But during the production for the 2014 re-release for the PS4/Xbox One/PC version, Rockstar games added the 1st person perspective as a novelty. This did mean that they had to update graphics like guns and car interiors, rework certain animations and in game physics. But they were already going to do that for the newer hardware anyways. And this is after game had already been released, so that meant no pressure from the public to rush it. So why _not_ add a 1st person POV option? And if you didn’t like it, you can turn it off with just a single button. You had the _option_ between 1st person and 3rd person. It was about **player choice and flexibility.** Which Cyberpunk didn’t provide. You were stuck in first person (except in cars) because they believed the entire experience needed to be built around that perspective to work properly. Just do 1st or 3rd person if you won’t let me choose. Don’t play both sides, you’ll fall.

### What did it cost?

So here’s what happened after it’s decision in 2016:

1. **Development reset:** Features, animations, and gameplay systems built for third-person had to be scrapped or rebuilt
2. **Character customization paradox:** Players spent hours customizing characters they'd barely see
3. **Cut features:** Wall-running, flying cars, and other mechanics that would have showcased the third-person perspective were abandoned
4. **Technical challenges:** The game's character models weren't even fully designed for third-person viewing. (modders discovered V is missing a head and has a strange elongated body when viewed externally. at least it wasn’t just a grey pill)

### The Invisible Character Problem

Here's something that didn't hit players until they were hours into the game: all that time you spent in character creation? Wasted. Not because the system was bad, but because you literally never see your character outside of:

1. Looking in mirrors (which you do maybe 3 times)
2. The inventory/upgrade screen
3. Photo mode (if you remember it exists)
4. Looking down at your feet like a weirdo

Compare this to The Witcher 3, where you see Geralt constantly. Every cutscene, every combat encounter, every moment of gameplay—you're looking at your character. Players formed attachments to Geralt's appearance, his animations, the way he moved through the world.

In Cyberpunk? V is essentially a ghost you occasionally glimpse. Some players reported feeling disconnected from their character despite spending 30+ minutes perfecting their look. One Reddit user said: "I made the most badass looking corpo V, gave her scars and everything. Then I played 60 hours and realized I forgot what she looked like."

The tragic irony? The character customization system is genuinely detailed—cyberware, tattoos, scars, piercings, multiple body types. CDPR put significant development time into a feature that became functionally cosmetic. That's dev time that could have gone toward fixing bugs, improving AI, or building out promised features.

Modders later discovered that V's character model is _literally incomplete_ when viewed from third-person. The head is missing (it's just floating hair), and the body has weird proportions because it was only designed to look correct from the first-person camera position. This wasn't an oversight—it was an intentional optimization. Why render a full character model when the player never sees it?

This is the cost of the 2016 perspective shift. They rebuilt the entire game around first-person, which meant features designed for third-person became vestigial. And unlike GTA V, where you could toggle perspectives and actually _use_ your customization, Cyberpunk locked you into a perspective that made one of its major RPG features largely irrelevant.

By 2023, CD Projekt Red stated they had "no regrets" about the first-person choice, though they haven't yet decided whether the sequel, Cyberpunk Orion, will also be first-person only. To which I can’t say I’m excited for, and I’d be lying if I said I was interested.

And unlike Rockstar's approach with GTA V, which added first-person as a bonus without compromising the core third-person design, CD Projekt Red went all-in on a single vision. Whether that was genius or hubris depends on who you ask.

Oh, and they were also building their game engine (REDengine 4) at the same time they were building the game and making this fundamental perspective shift. Imagine trying to build a house while simultaneously inventing new construction materials and deciding to turn it into a submarine halfway through. That’s just plain fucking stupidity.

### You LIED!

E3. Never been, never will. But E3 2018, CD Projekt Red showed a 50-minute gameplay demo to journalists, and it was fucking amazing. (according to game journalists. yuck). Gameplay was smooth, graphics were amazing unsurprisingly, RPG systems looked deep. Everyone lost their shit.

But of course, expectations vs reality. And reality is often disappointing. That demo was carefully crafted that didn’t represent that actual state of the game. What’s worse, creating the demo would _naturally_ delay the final build even more. They were showing off a product that didn't exist to build hype for a game they hadn't actually made yet. But maybe that’s just how the sun rises in the gaming industry.

The clock is ticking, the hype is real. What’s next, bucko?

## Act III: “Where is it?”

### June 2019

CD Projekt fuckward announces a release date of **April 16, 2020.** The crowd goes wild. Pre-orders flood in.

But back at DumbDumb HQ, devs were pulling their hair out. They knew this date was ambitious as fuck. But management pushed it anyway because investors needed a date, marketing needed a date, and the public was getting restless. And you kinda can’t blame them.

### January 2020

“Actually, we need until September 17. For polishing and playtesting.” Translation: The game is nowhere near done.

### March 2020

COVID-19 hits. The entire studio shifts to remote work. CD Projekt Red claims this won't cause delays. Spoiler alert: it did.

### June 2020

"September 17 is now November 19." Bug fixes, they said. More time, they said. This is when fans started getting pissed. This is when the Twitter discourse turned even more toxic. (Shockingly)

### October 2020

The game goes gold (meaning it's theoretically ready to ship). Then, _one month before launch_, they delay it AGAIN to December 10. Now you’re starting to piss ME off. (as I write this in 2025).

> Rush perfection, and you don’t get perfection. You get catastrophe.

### The Breaking Point

This October delay broke something in the community. Because "going gold" is supposed to mean the game is done. Delaying after going gold means either:

1. The game was never finished and they lied
2. Management realized too late that it was broken and lied anyways

But it got ✨ worse ✨.

Because once the delays kept piling up, the discourse shifted. It wasn't just impatience anymore—it was rage. And that's when the 'since 2012' bullshit started.”

### The pattern

Noticed something? All these game studios had massive teams, long development times and enormous budgets. Not to mention these were all talented classes, not your regulary Joe. These teams had a _passion_ for games and wanted to produce something from their hearts.

Yet people will STILL complain. They always do. But why did CD Projekt Red go through so much backlash while the rest didn’t?

- Didn’t announce the game 8 years prior.
- Set realistic expectations.
- Had the backing of massive parent companies.

This wasn’t entirely their fault. This was only their second major title ever made under the CD Projekt Red title. But **that doesn't excuse the fans who sent death threats to developers.** Ffs.

### So What's The Actual Problem Here?

Let's be clear about what the "since 2012" complaint misses:

**The Real Timeline**: 4-5 years of full production with 400 people is _completely normal_ for a game of this scope. The problem wasn't the development time—it was:

1. **Announcing 4+ years before production started** - This set a clock in people's heads that didn't match reality
2. **Team size vs. ambition mismatch** - They tried to match games made by 2,000-3,000 person teams with 400 people
3. **Management refusing to acknowledge they needed more time or more people** - Pride? Investor pressure? Stupidity? All three?

Red Dead Redemption 2 had 5x the people and took longer. Nobody complained because Rockstar announced it 2 years before release, not 8.

The Last of Us Part II had 2,169 developers across 14 studios. Nobody complained because Naughty Dog didn't announce it until they knew what they were building.

Elden Ring succeeded with a smaller team because FromSoftware:

- Didn't announce until 2 years into development
- Didn't reboot perspective mid-production
- Didn't promise features they couldn't deliver
- Actually knew what they were making

**The Lesson**: The development time wasn't the crime. The crime was announcing too early with a team too small for the scope, then refusing to adjust when reality hit. CDPR management created their own pressure cooker and then blamed fans for turning up the heat.

But fuck those fans who sent death threats. Seriously. The developers were doing their best with impossible conditions. Harassing individual devs because management fucked up is peak gamer entitlement bullshit.

### The outlier

Elden Ring? Why are we talking about this absolute fucking masterpiece? (Best game in the world btw). The difference in culture. Let me explain.

- Development time: ~5 years (2017-2022)
- Team size: **200-230 people at peak** (from a pool of 300 development staff at FromSoftware)
- Total FromSoftware employees: ~400 people
- Budget: ~$200 million
- Sold over 30 million copies
- Note: FromSoftware was **simultaneously developing Armored Core 6** with the same team pool, shuffling developers between projects as needed

So why did _this_ game get over 30 million copies sold and GotY 2022, with a 96 Metacritic score?

- **Asset reuse mastery**: FromSoftware is legendary at reusing and refining animations, systems, and design patterns from previous games
- **Focused scope**: They knew exactly what they were making and didn't chase every trendy feature
- **Experience**: By the time they made Elden Ring, FromSoftware had refined their formula across Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. Some of the most widely critically acclaimed games of all fucking time.
- **No feature creep**: They didn't reboot development halfway through or completely change perspective
- **Realistic ambitions**: The scope matched the team size and timeline

There was also one more factor that these other production didn’t suffer from. The Japanese work culture. FROMSOFTWARE being a Japanese company, the work ethic of working overtime with no pay and expected 80 hour workweek. Sometimes expect pregnant employees to leave the company for new hire. So yes, they were really fucking efficient and made, what I think, the best game to have ever made by one of my favourite company of all time. But with the expense of human ethics is challenging to bare. However, the Japanese work ethic is actively improving. So keep your hopes up.

## Act IV: “It’s Almost Dry” feat. Pharrell Williams and Kanye West

The game finally releases on December 10, 2020. And it’s not good.

A hot buggy mess even on high-end gaming PCs, especially on consoles like the PS5 and the Xbox Series X having it super rough. And if you didn’t have the best GPU and CPU available? Good luck.

- NPCs T-posing in cutscenes
- Cars falling from the sky
- Game-breaking quest bugs
- Constant crashes (every 30-60 minutes on base consoles)
- Frame rates dropping to single digits
- Textures not loading
- Physics going haywire

What’s worse is that features that were promised or shown in demos were a mirage.

- Meaningful lifepath choices (basically cosmetic)
- Deep NPC AI and routines (NPCs were dumb as rocks)
- Vehicle customization
- Metro system that actually worked
- Proper police chase mechanics (cops just spawned behind you. sounds like a poorly made FiveM server)

### The Reception

The internet had a field day. Reddit megathreads documented a billion issues. YouTubers made _career_ out of bug compilations. Review sites that had initially praised the game start to issue warnings in it.

> This game is promising. Update: Don’t buy it.

And I don’t know who at CD Projekt Red thought it would be a good idea to start HIDING REVIEWS for consoles. Pre-launch, they only sent out PC review codes and prohibited reviewers from using their own console footage. They knew. They fucking knew the console versions were broken, and they shipped them anyway. Scums.

On December 17, 2020, Sony pulls Cyberpunk 2077 from the Playstation and issued refunds from CD Projekt Red. Literally never happened before, ever. And only until June 2021 did it come back. The studio’s stock prices, naturally, tanked like Google’s prices when Deepseek was released. Class-action lawsuits are filed, alleging CD Projekt Red misled investors and consumers.

## Act V: “I trusted you”

$60. 60 buckos for spaghetti code. Players review bombed. That trust their fans had for CD Projekt Red eviscerated. Wither 3 what? Idk what you’re talking..

### But who’s to blame here?

And here's where the game's themes get darkly poetic. You know what Cyberpunk 2077 is about? Corporate greed crushing the individual. Megacorps prioritizing profit over human life. Workers treated as disposable. Marketing creating illusions while reality crumbles behind the curtain.

Sound familiar?

The developers were literally writing dialogue for Johnny Silverhand—a character who rages against corporate exploitation—while _experiencing_ corporate exploitation. They were coding scenes about workers being crushed by impossible deadlines while working mandatory 100-hour weeks. They were designing quests about deceptive corpo marketing while management hid console performance from reviewers.

The game became a mirror of its own creation. Art imitating life imitating art.

The fans were constantly demanding for the game to be released despite being told it’s already in production. This hate was fed by the demos and the fake release day and the delays.

The investors that know nothing about making a video game, demands for a release date. Which meant people could buy copies, which meant they would make a profit. And when money is involved, everyone is skeptical and inpatient.

The goddamn management. Setting unrealistic deadlines and refused to budge, even when the developers said it was practically impossible. They underestimated the project’s complexity and overestimated the team’s ability to chew more than they could swallow. The decision to release in December 2020 was made by executives who valued short-term financial gain over long-term reputation. They knew the game was broken. They knew console performance was unacceptable. They shipped it anyway.

## Act VI: "We're So Back" (2021-2025)

After launch, CD Projekt Red faced a choice: cut losses and run, or face the music and fix their mess.

They chose the harder path.

### The Long Road Back

For the next **four years**, CDPR released:

**2021**: The Year of Damage Control

- Patches 1.1 through 1.3: Literally hundreds of bug fixes
- Performance optimizations for last-gen consoles (though they never ran _great_)
- Sony re-lists the game on PlayStation Store in June 2021
- Free DLC started trickling in—cosmetics, weapons, apartments

**2022**: The Stability Year

- Patch 1.5: Next-gen console optimization (finally ran properly on PS5/Xbox Series X)
- More gameplay improvements, UI fixes, better AI
- The game became _playable_ across all platforms
- Player count started climbing back up on Steam

**2023**: The Redemption

- **Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty** drops—a massive expansion
- Update 2.0: Complete overhaul of police system, skill trees, vehicle combat
- Idris Elba joins the cast
- Critics actually praise it: "This is what Cyberpunk should have been"
- The expansion sold millions of copies

**2024-2025**: The Victory Lap

- Continued patches and improvements
- Community modding scene thrives
- Player sentiment shifts from "broken mess" to "hidden gem"
- Total sales exceed 30 million copies
- Netflix anime _Cyberpunk: Edgerunners_ (2022) brings new players
- Reviews shift from "Mixed" to "Mostly Positive" on Steam

### Did They Deserve Redemption?

Here's the uncomfortable question: Does fixing your fuck-up erase the fuck-up?

**Arguments for forgiveness:**

- They didn't abandon the game (many studios would have)
- They supported it for 4+ years post-launch
- They delivered on promises, eventually
- Phantom Liberty was genuinely excellent
- The game I played in 2025 is legitimately great

**Arguments against:**

- They only fixed it after lawsuits and financial disaster forced their hand
- The launch scammed millions of console players who paid full price
- Developer crunch and burnout can't be undone by patches
- Lost trust doesn't magically return with bug fixes
- Some players will never come back after getting burned

The truth? It's both. They redeemed the _game_ but not the _launch_. The product became what it should have been, but the process that created it—and destroyed it—remains a permanent stain.

### The Current State (2025)

Today, Cyberpunk 2077 is:

- A critical success (finally)
- Commercially successful (30M+ copies)
- Genuinely fun to play
- A cautionary tale that will follow CDPR forever

The game is great now. But "now" came four years too late for millions of people who paid $60 for a broken promise. No amount of patches can refund that lost time and trust.

## Epilogue: The Game I Played

I played Cyberpunk 2077 in June 2025, mostly because I was bored and had already finished Elden Ring for the third time. And honestly? It was fucking amazing.

Night City felt alive. The main story hit emotional beats I wasn't expecting. The side quests had more depth than most games' entire campaigns. The combat was satisfying, the RPG systems engaging, and despite the first-person limitation, I felt connected to V's journey.

This is the version that should have launched in 2020.

### The Haunting Question

But here's what keeps me up at night: **What if they had waited?**

Not just "what if they delayed to 2021?" but what if they had taken the time the game actually needed? What if they'd launched in 2025 instead of 2020?

Would we have gotten:

- **Deeper systems?** More complex NPC routines? A living city with actual AI that reacts to your actions?
- **More content?** The cut metro system? Flying cars? Wall-running?
- **Better storytelling?** More meaningful lifepath differences that actually affect the narrative?
- **Technical excellence?** Ray tracing on launch? Stable 60fps on all platforms?

Or would we have just gotten the same game, but stable?

**We'll never know.** That's the tragedy.

The game we got is great. But it's a salvaged masterpiece—rescued from disaster through years of triage. We'll never know what it could have been if it had been given the time, resources, and scope management it needed from the start instead of being fixed in post-launch emergency mode.

### What Cyberpunk Taught Us (That We'll Ignore)

This game should have taught the industry:

- ✗ Don't announce games years before production starts
- ✗ Don't crunch developers—it doesn't work
- ✗ Don't overpromise features you can't deliver
- ✗ Don't ship broken products to hit arbitrary deadlines
- ✗ Don't let investors dictate creative timelines

But let's be real: nobody learned shit. The industry continues making the same mistakes. Games are still announced too early. Developers are still crunched. Products are still shipped broken with "we'll patch it later" excuses.

Cyberpunk 2077 changed nothing. It'll happen again. It's probably happening right now at some studio while you read this.

### Final Thoughts

So here's my verdict: **Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece built on a foundation of failure.**

The game is incredible now. I recommend it to anyone asking. But I also recommend they know the story behind it—not to shame CDPR forever, but to understand why "just delay it bro" isn't a meme, it's a plea from developers who know how this ends.

The game warns you: in Night City, everyone's trying to become a legend before they burn out.

CD Projekt Red became a legend—of corporate hubris, developer suffering, and one of gaming's most spectacular disasters followed by one of its most impressive redemptions.

The code is debugged. The performance is optimized. The game is great.

But the lesson remains: **Rush perfection, and you don't get perfection. You get catastrophe. And if you're very, very lucky, you might get a second chance years later to turn that catastrophe into something beautiful.**

CD Projekt Red got lucky. Most studios don't.

Welcome to Night City, choom. The game is finally ready. Only took four years longer than it should have.

_Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some cyberpsychos to hunt._
