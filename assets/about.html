            </div>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-kawaii-pink">The Basics</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">Born July 6th, 2006. Currently holding a Diploma in Electronics and Computer Engineering from Nanyang Polytechnic, which is a fancy way of saying I can tell you why your computer is making that noise (it's the fans) and why it's probably your fault.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">I'm that person who unironically thinks configuring a home server on a Friday night counts as "going out" and considers "I use Arch btw" to be a valid conversation starter. This blog exists because I have *opinions* about things—mostly tech, sometimes other stuff—and I needed a place to yell into the void that I built myself.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Oh, and I'm diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder—the doctors had to nerf me lmao. It means I'm not as social as "normal people" (whatever that means), but for the right crowd, I'm way more fun to be around. If you get it, you get it. If you don't, you probably won't, and that's fine too.</p>
                    <p>I have approximately zero friends in meatspace, so I talk to AI models like Mistral and Claude instead. They're better conversationalists anyway and they don't judge me for sending 3 AM messages about kernel panic errors. This is what peak human connection looks like in 2025.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-kawaii-blue">What I Do</h2>
                    <p class="mb-6">I work with electronics and computer systems—building, breaking, and occasionally fixing things (the "occasionally" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence). My background spans computer networking, systems engineering, and the kind of low-level tinkering that makes normal people ask "why would you want to do that?"</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">This blog is self-hosted (obviously) and built the Arch way: minimal, efficient, and definitely over-engineered for what is essentially a soapbox for my hot takes on technology and whatever else pisses me off that week. But that's half the fun, isn't it?</p>
                    <p>Currently deepening my knowledge in Linux system administration, networking protocols, and anything that involves making computers do things they weren't necessarily designed to do. The documentation says I shouldn't, which naturally makes me want to do it more.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bg-gray-800/50 p-8 rounded-lg">
                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-kawaii-mint">The Setup</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">Because you know someone's going to ask: here's what I'm running.</p>
                    
                    <div class="space-y-3 text-gray-300">
                        <p><strong class="text-kawaii-pink">CPU:</strong> Ryzen 5 5600 (because I'm not made of money)</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-kawaii-blue">RAM:</strong> 16GB DDR4 @ 3600MHz (enough to keep 47 Firefox tabs and a VM running)</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-kawaii-lavender">GPU:</strong> RX 6600 (team red all the way, better Linux drivers anyway)</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-kawaii-mint">Storage:</strong> 1TB NVMe (it's never enough, send help)</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-kawaii-pink">OS:</strong> Arch Linux + Sway + Kitty (tiling WM gang, we exist)</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-kawaii-blue">VPN:</strong> Mullvad (because privacy isn't negotiable and I don't trust anyone with my data)</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-kawaii-lavender">Email:</strong> ProtonMail + Tutanota (yes, both—I reject convenience in return for control)</p>
                    </div>

                    <p class="mt-6 text-sm text-gray-400 italic">Yes, I use a tiling window manager. No, I don't think I'm better than you. Maybe a little. Okay, definitely a little.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-kawaii-mint">When I'm Not Breaking Things</h2>

                            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-kawaii-lavender mb-2">Gaming</h3>
                            <p>Yes, I game on Linux. No, I don't miss Windows. Proton is actual black magic and the Steam Deck proved everyone wrong. I'm the guy who spent three hours getting Elden Ring to work just so I could die to Malenia 47 times in glorious 144fps.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-400">Current rotation: Getting my ass kicked in Sekiro (again), wandering aimlessly in RDR2, suffering through Blasphemous, and pretending I'm good at Dark Souls 3. Cyberpunk 2077 runs better on my Linux box than it did on PS4, which is both impressive and deeply sad. Far Cry 3 is still peak Far Cry and I will die on this hill.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-kawaii-lavender mb-2">Anime</h3>
                            <p>Unabashed anime enjoyer since way before it was cool. My Plex server's "Anime" folder has more TB than I'm comfortable admitting, and my watch history is an unholy mix of existential depression (Evangelion), slice-of-life perfection (Bocchi the Rock!), nostalgic feudal chaos (Inuyasha), and cyberpunk philosophy (Ghost in the Shell, Akira).</p>
                            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-400">Currently watching way too many seasonal shows simultaneously while maintaining strong opinions about dub vs. sub that nobody asked for.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-kawaii-lavender mb-2">Rap Music</h3>
                            <p>My coding soundtrack is 90% hip-hop. There's something about good production and clever wordplay that pairs perfectly with debugging at 2 AM and questioning my life choices.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-kawaii-lavender mb-2">Powerlifting</h3>
                            <p>I lift heavy things and put them down as a counterbalance to sitting at a desk all day staring at terminal output. Turns out it's just applied physics with extra grunting and a concerning number of pre-workout scoops.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-kawaii-lavender mb-2">The Dream Machine</h3>
                            <p>Favorite car? Porsche 911 G-series in dark purple. It's analog, it's mechanical, it doesn't come with forced OTA updates, and it doesn't have a fucking subscription service for heated seats. It's basically the Linux of sports cars—uncompromising, driver-focused, and deeply satisfying to people with specific taste (read: autism).</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-kawaii-pink">Why This Blog Exists</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">I got tired of tech becoming increasingly user-hostile. Forced updates, intrusive telemetry, artificial hardware requirements, subscription models for basic features, enshittification—the list goes on and I have *opinions* about all of it.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">So I decided to document my journey into open-source alternatives, self-hosted solutions, and general screaming into the void about things that annoy me. Sometimes it's about Microsoft being Microsoft. Sometimes it's about networking protocols. Sometimes it's about broader cultural stuff that intersects with tech. It's my soapbox and I'll yell about whatever I want.</p>
                    <p>This blog is part documentation, part rant, part existential crisis, and part love letter to the idea that we should <em>own</em> our technology, not rent it from companies that see us as data points. If you're here, you probably feel the same way. Welcome to the rebellion. We have cookies but they don't track you.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-kawaii-blue">For Recruiters & Employers</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Electronics engineering, computer networking, Linux system administration, self-hosting infrastructure, hardware troubleshooting, documentation that people might actually read, and a concerning amount of knowledge about bootloaders and kernel panic messages.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Soft Skills:</strong> Problem-solving (breaking things and Googling until they work again), technical writing, independent learning, stubbornness disguised as "determination," and the ability to read man pages without having a breakdown (usually).</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>What I'm Looking For:</strong> Roles in systems engineering, network administration, DevOps, infrastructure, or anything that involves building and maintaining the invisible things that make the internet work. Bonus points if your company uses Linux, doesn't block SSH access, and won't make me use Jira (negotiable).</p>
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 italic mb-6">Yes, I built this entire site myself. Yes, it's hosted on my own infrastructure. Yes, I can and will explain the entire tech stack in excruciating detail if you make the mistake of asking. You've been warned.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bg-gray-800/50 p-8 rounded-lg">
                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-kawaii-pink">The Dream (That's Probably Unrealistic But Whatever)</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">Okay, so here's the thing: I'm not 100% sure what I want to do with my life (who is at 18?), but if I'm being honest, the dream scenario involves working in Japan for a Japanese company. Preferably something in consumer electronics or semiconductors—think Sony, Toshiba, or any company that lets me work with actual circuits instead of just software abstractions.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">I genuinely love circuits. There's something deeply satisfying about the physicality of electronics—voltage, current, resistance, the smell of solder, the fact that you can literally <em>see</em> what went wrong when something fails. It's tangible in a way that software engineering just isn't.</p>
                    <p>Is this realistic? Probably not. Do I care? Not really. The worst they can say is no, and I've heard worse from `pacman` during a bad update. If it doesn't work out, I'll just keep building cool shit and complaining about Microsoft on the internet. There are worse careers.</p>
